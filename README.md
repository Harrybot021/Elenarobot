  ## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older Python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which is ordered by default in 3.6.

  ### Configuration

There are two possible ways of configuring your bot: a config.py file, or ENV variables.

The preferred version is to use a `config.py` file, as it makes it easier to see all your settings grouped together.
This file should be placed in your `LaylaRobot` folder, alongside the `__main__.py` file. 
This is where your bot token will be loaded from, as well as your database URI (if you're using a database), and most of 
your other settings.

It is recommended to import sample_config and extend the Config class, as this will ensure your config contains all 
defaults set in the sample_config, hence making it easier to upgrade.

An example `config.py` file could be:
```
from LaylaRobot.sample_config import Config

class Development(Config):
    OWNER_ID = 254318997  # your telegram ID
    OWNER_USERNAME = "SonOfLars"  # your telegram username
    API_KEY = "your bot api key"  # your api key, as provided by the @botfather
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database'  # sample db credentials
    MESSAGE_DUMP = '-1234567890' # some group chat that your bot is a member of
    USE_MESSAGE_DUMP = True
    SUDO_USERS
